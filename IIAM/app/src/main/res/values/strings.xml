	 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between User and

	previous oral or written communications, proposals, agreements and
	representations, if any, relating to the subject matter hereof.
	JHU/KKI reserves the right to modify this Agreement and to impose
	new or additional terms or conditions on the access, viewing and use
	of the Application at any time and in its sole discretion. Such
	modifications and additional terms and conditions will be effective
	immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. The continued use
	of the Application by or on behalf of User will be deemed acceptance
	thereof. The failure of any party to require the performance of any
	term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by any party of
	any breach of this Agreement, will not act as a bar to subsequent
	enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any
	subsequent breach.  The provisions of this Agreement will be
	considered severable, so that the invalidity or unenforceability of
	any provisions will not affect the validity or enforceability of the
	remaining provisions; provided that no such severability will be
	effective if it materially changes the agreement contained herein.
	Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations of User
	hereunder may be assigned or delegated by User in whole or in part
	without the prior written approval of JHU/KKI. Any assignment or
	delegation in derogation of the foregoing shall be null and void.
	The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
	only and will not affect in any way the meaning and interpretation
	of this Agreement.  All terms and conditions that by their nature
	should survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement,
	including, without limitation, Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 hereof, will
	survive.  User hereby agrees that User will not use or otherwise
	export the Application in violation or prohibition of United States
	and any other applicable laws, statutes and regulations.  </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>
